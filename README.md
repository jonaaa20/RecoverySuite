# RecoverySuite
A simple Recovery Project i made, i've been using for more than 2 years, or maybe less, can't remember now.

Anyway, it should include a lot of cool stuff if you like recovery, the classic (and probably detected?) casino method but with some cool upgrades (like the Trigger Transaction one) and some cool stuff included with the unlock options, try it!

# Why releasing it?

I, uhh, i'm tired of playing GTA since what's more popular are kicks and crashes, well, the community changed, i miss the old 2013 times when everything was about recovery.

...anyway, it's fully updated and it should work fine but i won't update this repository when the next update comes out so, study the code, i know you can do it, it's easy, and i hope someone will do a better recovery than i did, thanks for tuning in!
